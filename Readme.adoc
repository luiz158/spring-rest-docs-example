= Spring Rest Docs Example

Showcase testing api with different versions.

Aproach:

Output every API version snippets to different folder and use them
in the asciidoctor file compilation.
Use command to build code, test and generate documentation

`gradlew asciidoctor`

Spring Rest Docs supports `RestAssured` as an alternative to `MockMVC`.
Asciidoctor can be quite flexible in terms of styling etc. you can also use custom directives and inject javascript code to create a slick ui.

Gradle also support incremental recompilation using

`gradlew asciidoctor -t`
