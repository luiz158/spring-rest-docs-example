= Spring Rest Docs Example

Showcase testing api with different versions.

The aproach followed here:

Output every API version snippets to different folder and use them
in the asciidoctor file compilation.

use command to build code, test and generate documentation

gradlew build asciidoctor

Spring Rest Docs supports RestAssured as an alternative to MockMVC and it can be configured as a totally different project
for example one could setup spring boot with Spring Rest Docs to test the apis and have no dependency on current codebase.
In the case of MockMVC that would not work as MockMVC needs the container that the application is running.


Asciidoctor can be quite flexible in terms of styling etc. you can also use custom directives and inject javascript code.
